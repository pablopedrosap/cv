<p>I have recruited A+ players to my marketing team to make sure companies we love to work with develop the easy and
    straight to the point appointment setting for clients using automation for the sake of gaining control of time.
    <br>
    I also use automation in my futures portfolio using ML in order to have time developing my background
    in engineering, AI and business.</p>

<h3>Here are my habits to be the best I can be.</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Meditate at least 15 minutes a day to maintain a high level of self-awareness.</li>
    <li>Read for 1h a day including topics I'm not comfortable with yet.</li>
    <li>Attend the gym 1h every day with proper calories to have an aesthetic body + be confident + be attractive.</li>
    <li>Work/Make effort creatively, eliminating all distraction, for as long as possible. Once finished, work.</li>
    <li>Make someone's life better, (a bit better is also valid and if there is fear on my part even better).</li>
    <li>Sleep at least 8h every day.</li>
</ul>
